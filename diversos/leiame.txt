image2cpp

image2cpp is a simple tool to change images into byte arrays 
(or arrays back into an images) for use with (monochrome) 
displays such as OLEDs on your Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
It was originally made to work with the Adafruit OLED library 
(for which your can find an example sketch for Arduino here) 
but has been expanded by the community to be useful in all 
kind of (embedded) projects.
